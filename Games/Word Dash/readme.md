# Word Dash

A typing game where the player attempts to type out a randomly generated sentence as quickly and accurately as possible. The game uses the curses library to create a terminal interface.

## How to play

- The game starts with a main menu, where the player can press any key to start the game.
- The player will then be presented with a 3 second countdown before the sentence to type appears on the screen.
- The player must type out the sentence as quickly and accurately as possible.
- The game will display the player's WPM (words per minute) as they type.
- Once the player has fully typed out the sentence, their final WPM will be displayed on the screen.
- The player can then press enter to play again or press escape to return to the main menu.
